# React Redux Webpack Boilerplate

## Features

This react boilerplate contains the following features:

* [Webpack 4](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io) for transpiling ES6 and ES7 
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) 
* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) for global state management
* [Redux Thunk Middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and CSS3 support

#### Development Features
* [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) A blazing fast local development server, with hot reloading
* [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) ability to modify react components in real time, without reloading the page, and without losing component state when using webpack dev server
* [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) to easily navigate your redux store tree and see actions and their effects, live.
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org) to maintain a consistent code style throughout your application
<!-- * [font-awesome-webpack](https://github.com/gowravshekar/font-awesome-webpack) to customize Bootstrap and FontAwesome -->
<!-- * [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) to manage title and meta tag information on both server and client -->

## Installation

```bash
npm install # install all the boilerplate dependencies
```

## Running Dev Server

```bash
npm run start # local webpack-dev-server with hot reloading
```

Start rapidly developing using the command above.

## Build Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will output your built web app in ```dist/``` folder. Thereafter you can copy and paste the contents of this folder to any static web host such as, [godaddy](https://godaddy.com), [hostpapa](https://hostpapa.com) into the public/root directory.
**It. Just. Works.**

If you would like to deploy to **modern web hosts**, it's even **easier**.

## Deployment on Surge.sh

 **Pre-requiste:** Build Production first (to generate dist folder)

### Install Surge CLI Globally
```bash
npm install --g surge
```

### Deploy
In your project directory just run:
```bash
surge -p dist
```

After which you will be shown your project & domain name. 
Hit ```Enter``` and it will build and deploy in a jiffy.

## Deployment on Netlify

### Using Redux DevTools

[Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) are enabled by default in development.

If you have the [Redux DevTools chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) installed it will automatically detect and you can start using it straight away.

<!-- DevTools are not enabled during production. -->

### Using The ```public/``` Folder

The ```public/``` folder located at the root of this boilerplate is where you can place, favicons, htacess, redirect files etc, that will automatically get added to the ```dist/``` when you build your project for production.

<!-- DevTools are not enabled during production. -->


## Demo

A demonstration of this app can be seen [running on surge](http://boilerplate-redux.surge.sh)
<!-- , which is a deployment of the [netlify branch](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example/tree/heroku). -->


<!-- #### Images

Now it's possible to render the image both on client and server. Please refer to issue [#39](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example/issues/39) for more detail discussion, the usage would be like below (super easy):

```javascript
let logoImage = require('./logo.png');
``` -->
